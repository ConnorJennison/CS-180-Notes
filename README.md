# CS-180-Notes
UCLA Course Title: Algorithms & Complexity

Description:
Introduction to design and analysis of algorithms. 
Design techniques:reduction, divide-and-conquer, greedy method, dynamic programming, network
flow; choice of data structures and representations. We will cover complexity
measures including time and space, upper and lower bounds, asymptotic complexity;
NP-completeness, use of randomness. If time permits, I will present advanced topics,
such as PSPACE and other complexity classes.

These are my notes.  Material for current course may be different. Use at your own risk
